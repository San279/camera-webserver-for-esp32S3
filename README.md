# Esp32 image collection webserver for Edge Impulse
This project was intended to use for collecting images from Esp32S3 to train FOMO model in Edge Impulse. Instead of saving images to the SD card like most Esp32 webserver projects, users can inspect each image from the camera and delete at will. Furthermore, users can manipulate Esp32 Camera resolutions and sensors settings sucn as brightness,saturations, and etc. Just download the files and place it inside the Arduino Libraries and you're good to go!
